# The Medium is the New Tab -- mushroomspores -- the backend

Have you ever wanted to share an emotion with someone far far away? Studies show that images are a powerful medium, activating our brains on the levels of the symbolic and imaginary. This add-on creates a space for you to project your visions. 

A Google Chrome and Firefox extension that allow groups or couples to see the same image as a background when they open a new tab. They can link this with a Tumblr feed for personalized images. Backend built using Flask REST APIs on Heroku with PostgreSQL.
